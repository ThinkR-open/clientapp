# clientapp

The goal of {clientapp} is to build a shiny app in a R package to
explore a (fake) client database. Building a Shiny Application included
in a R package is made easier with
[{golem}](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem). Database was built
using [{fakir}](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fakir).

This app is deployed there: <https://connect.thinkr.fr/clientapp/>

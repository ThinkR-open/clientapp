# clientapp

The goal of {clientapp} is to build a shiny app in a R package to explore a (fake) client database. Building a Shiny Application included in a R package is made easier with [{golem}](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem). Database was built using [{fakir}](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fakir).

This app is deployed there: https://connect.thinkr.fr/clientapp/
